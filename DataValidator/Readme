    Purpose: Compare Template Substitution Fields against Substitution Data being sent to the template.
    The main function, SubDataCheck is meant to be called with the substitution data and/or global substitution data just before adding it into the transmission call.  
    It will check to make sure that there is a corresponding substitution field for each field the template is looking for.
    
    EndPoint (1)
    SubDataCheck, the main application is expecting the following parameters:

    apikey								              Y               This application uses your account to get the Template from your account.  It needs an API key with the ability to read templates

    recsub                            	N               This can be blank, but if sent you must send it in the following format
    												  	                        {"substitution_data" : {fields.........arrays......etc}}
    globalsub                        	  N               This can be blank, but if sent you must send it in the following format
    												  	                        {"substitution_data" : {fields.........arrays......etc}}
    substitutionItemList            	  Y               An empty array that SubDataCheck will fill with a list of all fields found in the rec and global substitution data blocks
    templateItemList                	  Y               An empty array that SubDataCheck will fill with a list of all fields found in the template
    missingFields                    	  Y               An empty array that SubDataCheck will fill with a list of any field found in the template but NOT being sent to it via the recipient/global data
    
    
    EndPoint (2)
    IsJson, is a short function that allows you to validate the structure of your data (recipient/global) before sending it to SubDataCheck.  Just like SubDataCheck, the substitution_data block must be surrounded by {}

    string                            	Y               The function will validate the string to make sure they are properly formatted JSON
